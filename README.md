# Drag and Drop Workshop

This app demonstrates a few different ways to drag and drop elements using [React-Draggable](https://github.com/mzabriskie/react-draggable) and the native [HTML5 Drag and Drop api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API).

### Instructions

To experiment with each method of drag and drop in this repo, go into the Javascript files inside each folder within the Components folder. There are comments with instructions/ explanations inside the code.

Here is a descent tutorial on using the native drag and drop api: [css-tricks drag and drop](https://css-tricks.com/creating-a-parking-game-with-the-html-drag-and-drop-api/)
